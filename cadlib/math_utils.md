I don't have access to the code in `/content/code/cadlib/math_utils.py` and therefore cannot provide the code snippet. The purpose of `/content/code/cadlib/math_utils.py` is likely to provide various mathematical utility functions that are used in the CAD modeling process. These functions may include operations such as transformations, numericalization, and denumericalization of CAD shapes, as well as vector representation and conversion.
