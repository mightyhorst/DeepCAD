I don't have access to the code in `/content/code/utils/pc_utils.py` as it is not provided in the given context. Without the code snippet, I cannot determine the specific purpose of the `pc_utils.py` file. However, based on its name, it is likely that the file contains utility functions related to point cloud (pc) processing and manipulation. These utilities may include functions for reading, writing, and manipulating point cloud data.
