The purpose of the `__init__.py` file in the `/content/code/utils` directory is to make the `utils` directory a Python package. This allows the modules and functions within the `utils` directory to be imported and used in other parts of the codebase.

The code snippet for the `__init__.py` file may look like this:

```python
from .file_utils import *
from .pc_utils import *
```

This code imports all the modules and functions from the `file_utils` and `pc_utils` modules within the `utils` package. By doing this, any other module that imports the `utils` package can directly access these modules and functions without having to import them individually.
