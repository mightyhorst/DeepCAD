The `/content/code/model/autoencoder.py` file contains the implementation of an autoencoder model. This model is used for encoding and decoding data.

Here is the code snippet from the `/content/code/model/autoencoder.py` file:

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch

class Generator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, n_dim, h_dim, z_dim):
        super(Generator, self).__init__()

        main = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(n_dim, h_dim),
            nn.LeakyReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Linear(h_dim, h_dim),
            nn.LeakyReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Linear(h_dim, h_dim),
            nn.LeakyReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Linear(h_dim, z_dim),
        )
        self.main = main

    def forward(self, noise):
        output = self.main(noise)
        output = torch.tanh(output)
        return output


class Discriminator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, h_dim, z_dim):
        super(Discriminator, self).__init__()

        main = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(z_dim, h_dim),
            nn.LeakyReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Linear(h_dim, h_dim),
            nn.LeakyReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Linear(h_dim, h_dim),
            nn.LeakyReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Linear(h_dim, 1),
        )
        self.main = main

    def forward(self, inputs):
        output = self.main(inputs)
        return output.view(-1)
```

The code defines two classes: `Generator` and `Discriminator`. 

The `Generator` class represents the generator part of the autoencoder. It takes as input a noise vector and passes it through a series of linear layers with leaky ReLU activations. The final output is passed through a `tanh` activation function to produce the generated data.

The `Discriminator` class represents the discriminator part of the autoencoder. It takes as input the generated data and passes it through a series of linear layers with leaky ReLU activations. The final output is a single value representing the authenticity of the input data.

These two classes are used in the implementation of the autoencoder model, which is not included in the code snippet.
