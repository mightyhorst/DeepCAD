The Transformer model is a type of neural network architecture that is commonly used in natural language processing tasks. Its purpose is to process sequential data, such as sentences or documents, and capture the relationships between the different elements of the sequence. The Transformer model is particularly effective for tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and language generation, as it can learn to understand the context and meaning of words and phrases in a given sequence. It achieves this by using a combination of self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks.
