The file `/content/code/model/layers/improved_transformer.py` contains the implementation of the `TransformerDecoderLayerImproved` class, which is a subclass of the `Module` class from the `torch.nn` module. This class represents a decoder layer in a transformer model. It includes multi-head attention mechanisms, feedforward layers, layer normalization, and dropout. The class also defines the forward method for performing the forward pass of the decoder layer.
