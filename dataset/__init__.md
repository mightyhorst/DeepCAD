The purpose of the `/content/code/dataset/__init__.py` file is to initialize the `dataset` module and provide a package-level interface for importing dataset-related classes and functions.

Here is an example code snippet for the `__init__.py` file:

```python
from .shape_codes_dataset import ShapeCodesDataset

__all__ = ['ShapeCodesDataset']
```

In this example, the `ShapeCodesDataset` class is imported from the `shape_codes_dataset` module and made available for import from the `dataset` package. The `__all__` variable is used to specify which names should be imported when using the `from dataset import *` syntax. In this case, only the `ShapeCodesDataset` class is imported.
