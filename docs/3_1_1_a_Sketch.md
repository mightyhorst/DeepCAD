#### 3.1.1.a. Sketch. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. In CAD terminology,
each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile (see “Sketch 1” in Fig. 2). In our representation, a profile is described by a list of loops on its boundary; a loop always starts with an indicator command hSOLi followed by a series of curve commands `Ci`

We list all the curves on the loop in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left; and the loops in a profile are sorted according to the bottom-left corners of their bounding boxes. 

> Figure 2 illustrates two sketch profiles.

In practice, we consider three kinds of curve commands that are the most widely used: draw a line, an arc, and a circle. While other curve commands can be easily added (see Sec. 5), statistics from our large-scale real-world dataset (described in Sec. 3.3) show that these three types of commands constitute 92% of the cases.

Each curve command `Ci` is described by its curve type `ti ∈ { <SOL>, L, A, R}` and its parameters listed in Table 1.

Curve parameters specify the curve’s 2D location in the sketch plane’s local frame of reference, whose own position and orientation in 3D will be described shortly in the associated extrusion command. Since the curves in each loop are concatenated one after another, for the sake of compactness
we exclude the curve’s starting position from its parameter
list; each curve always starts from the ending point of its predecessor in the loop. The first curve always starts from the origin of the sketch plane, and the world-space coordinate
of the origin is specified in the extrusion command.

In short, a sketch profile S is described by a list of loops `S = [Q1, . . . , QN ]`, where each loop Qi consists of a series of curves starting from the indicator command hSOLi (i.e., `Qi = [ <SOL>, C1, . . . , Cni]`), and each curve command `Cj = (tj , pj )` specifies the curve type ti and its shape parameters `pj` (see Fig. 2).

# Summary
**Context:**
This section, titled "3.1.1.a. Sketch," focuses on explaining the representation of sketch commands in the DeepCAD model. Sketch commands are used to define closed curves on a 2D plane within 3D space. These curves are organized into loops, and loops are used to create closed regions known as profiles. The section outlines how profiles and loops are described in their representation, the ordering of loops, and the most commonly used curve commands, such as lines, arcs, and circles, along with their parameters.

1. **Summary in Simple Language:**
   In this section, the paper talks about sketch commands, which are used to draw 2D shapes in 3D space. These shapes are made up of closed curves, and a group of curves forms a closed region called a profile. Each profile can have one or more loops, and loops are made up of curve commands. The paper explains how they organize these curves, how loops are sorted, and the types of curve commands they use, like lines, arcs, and circles. These curve commands have parameters that describe their shapes, like their position and size.

3. **Simple Python Code Using PyTorch:**

   To represent a sketch profile with loops and curves in Python, you can use a nested list structure. Here's an example:

   ```python
   # Define a sketch profile with loops and curves
   sketch_profile = [
       # Loop 1
       [
           "<SOL>",  # Loop indicator
           ["L", (2, 0)],  # Line command
           ["A", (2, 2, 3.1415, 1)]  # Arc command
       ],
       # Loop 2
       [
           "<SOL>",  # Loop indicator
           ["R", (2, 1, 0.5)]  # Circle command
       ]
   ]

   # Print the sketch profile
   for loop in sketch_profile:
       print("Loop:")
       for command in loop:
           if isinstance(command, str):
               print(f"Loop Indicator: {command}")
           else:
               cmd, params = command[0], command[1]
               print(f"Curve Command: {cmd}, Parameters: {params}")
   ```

   This code defines a sketch profile with two loops, each containing curve commands. You can adapt this structure to represent more complex sketch profiles with various types of curves and parameters, similar to what the paper describes.
