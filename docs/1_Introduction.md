1. Introduction
It is our human nature to imagine and invent, and to express our invention in 3D shapes. This is what the paper and
pencil were used for when Leonardo da Vinci sketched his
mechanisms; this is why such drawing tools as the parallel
bar, the French curve, and the divider were devised; and this
is wherefore, in today’s digital era, the computer aided design (CAD) software have been used for 3D shape creation
in a myriad of industrial sectors, ranging from automotive
and aerospace to manufacturing and architectural design.
Can the machine also invent 3D shapes? Leveraging the
striking advance in generative models of deep learning, lots
of recent research efforts have been directed to the generation
of 3D models. However, existing 3D generative models
merely create computer discretization of 3D shapes: 3D
point clouds [6, 52, 53, 8, 30], polygon meshes [17, 42, 31],
and levelset fields [12, 33, 29, 50, 11]. Still missing is the
ability to generate the very nature of 3D shape design—the
drawing process We propose a deep generative network that outputs a sequence of operations used in CAD tools (such as SolidWorks
and AutoCAD) to construct a 3D shape. Generally referred
as a CAD model, such an operational sequence represents the
“drawing” process of shape creation. Today, almost all the industrial 3D designs start with CAD models. Only until later
in the production pipeline, if needed, they are discretized
into polygon meshes or point clouds.
To our knowledge, this is the first work toward a generative model of CAD designs. The challenge lies in the
CAD design’s sequential and parametric nature. A CAD
model consists of a series of geometric operations (e.g.,
curve sketch, extrusion, fillet, boolean, chamfer), each controlled by certain parameters. Some of the parameters are
discrete options; others have continuous values (more discussion in Sec. 3.1). These irregularities emerge from the
user creation process of 3D shapes, and thus contrast starkly
to the discrete 3D representations (i.e., voxels, point clouds, and meshes) used in existing generative models. In consequence, previously developed 3D generative models are
unsuited for CAD model generation.
Technical contributions. To overcome these challenges,
we seek a representation that reconciles the irregularities in
CAD models. We consider the most frequently used CAD
operations (or commands), and unify them in a common
structure that encodes their command types, parameters, and
sequential orders. Next, drawing an analogy between CAD
command sequences and natural languages, we propose an
autoencoder based on the Transformer network [40]. It embeds CAD models into a latent space, and later decode a
latent vector into a CAD command sequence. To train our
autoencoder, we further create a new dataset of CAD command sequences, one that is orders of magnitude larger than
the existing dataset of the same type. We have also made
this dataset publicly available1
to promote future research
on learning-based CAD designs.
Our method is able to generate plausible and diverse CAD
designs (see Fig. 1). We carefully evaluate its generation
quality through a series of ablation studies. Lastly, we end
our presentation with an outlook on useful applications enabled by our CAD autoencoder.


# Summary
This section discusses the introduction and motivation behind the paper "DeepCAD: A Deep Generative Network for Computer-Aided Design Models." It explores the challenge of using generative models to create 3D CAD designs, focusing on the sequential and parametric nature of CAD operations. The section outlines the technical contributions of the paper, which include proposing a representation for CAD operations, using a Transformer-based autoencoder to embed CAD models into a latent space, and creating a large dataset of CAD command sequences for training the autoencoder.

1. **Summary in Simple Language:**
   This section introduces the paper's topic, which is about using advanced computer techniques to generate 3D shapes like those made in computer-aided design (CAD) software. It discusses how people have been inventing 3D shapes throughout history, and how computers are now used to help with this process. The paper aims to teach computers to "invent" 3D shapes by creating a special program. This program will understand and create the steps needed to build a 3D shape, just like how a designer uses CAD software. This is important for industries like manufacturing and architecture. The paper explains that existing methods for generating 3D shapes have limitations, and it introduces a new approach that can generate CAD designs.

3. **Simple Python Code Using PyTorch:**

   Here's a simplified Python code snippet using PyTorch to create a basic autoencoder model. This example does not cover the specifics of the paper's approach but serves as a general illustration of how autoencoders work.

   ```python
   import torch
   import torch.nn as nn
   import torch.optim as optim

   # Define a simple autoencoder model
   class Autoencoder(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self):
           super(Autoencoder, self).__init__()
           self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
               nn.Linear(784, 128),
               nn.ReLU(),
               nn.Linear(128, 64),
               nn.ReLU()
           )
           self.decoder = nn.Sequential(
               nn.Linear(64, 128),
               nn.ReLU(),
               nn.Linear(128, 784),
               nn.Sigmoid()
           )

       def forward(self, x):
           encoded = self.encoder(x)
           decoded = self.decoder(encoded)
           return decoded

   # Initialize the autoencoder model
   model = Autoencoder()

   # Define a loss function and optimizer
   criterion = nn.MSELoss()
   optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

   # Training loop (not covering data loading in this example)
   for epoch in range(10):
       for data in dataloader:
           inputs, _ = data
           optimizer.zero_grad()
           outputs = model(inputs)
           loss = criterion(outputs, inputs)
           loss.backward()
           optimizer.step()
       print(f'Epoch [{epoch + 1}/10], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')

   # After training, you can use the encoder or decoder for various tasks
   encoded_data = model.encoder(input_data)
   reconstructed_data = model.decoder(encoded_data)
   ```

   This code demonstrates a basic autoencoder model in PyTorch, which can be a fundamental building block for more complex models like the one proposed in the paper. The paper's approach uses a Transformer-based autoencoder specifically designed for CAD models, which is more advanced than this simple example.
