### 3.1.1 Specification of CAD Commands
Full-fledged CAD tools support a rich set of commands,
although in practice only a small fraction of them are commonly used. Here, we consider a subset of the commands that are of frequent use (see Table 1). These commands fall
into two categories, namely sketch and extrusion. While conceptually simple, they are sufficiently expressive to generate a wide variety of shapes, as has been demonstrated in [48].

**CAD commands and their parameters**
> Table 1. CAD commands and their parameters. `<SOL>` indicates the start of a loop; `<EOS>` indicates the end of the whole sequence.

| Commands | Parameters |
| --- | --- |
| `<SOL>`  | ∅ | 
| L (Line) | x, y : line end-point | 
| A (Arc) |     x, y : arc end-point  |
|  |     α : sweep angle |
|  |     f : counter-clockwise flag |
| R (Circle) | x, y : center |
|  | r : radius |
| E (Extrude) |  θ, φ, γ : sketch plane orientation |
|  |  px, py, pz : sketch plane origin |
|  |  s : scale of associated sketch profile |
|  |  e1, e2 : extrude distances toward both sides |
|  |  b : boolean type, u : extrude type |
| `<EOS>` | ∅ |

**Parametrized command sequence:**
| index | Commands | Parameters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `<SOL>`  | ∅ |
| 2 |  L  | (2,0)  |
| 3 |  A  |  (2,2,π, 1) |
| 4 |  L  | (0, 2)  |
| 5 |  L  | (0, 0)  |
| 6 | `<SOL>`  | ∅ |
| 7 |  R  | (2,1,0.5)  |
| 8 |  E  | (0,0,0,-2,-1,0,3, 1, 0, 'New body', 'One-sided')  |
| 9 | `<SOL>`  | ∅ |
| 10 |  R  | (0,0,1.125)  |
| 11 |  E  | (0,0,0,-2,-1,0, 2.25, 2, 0, 'Join', 'One-sided')  |
| 12 |  `<EOS>`  | ∅ |

# Summary
**Context:**
This section, titled "3.1.1 Specification of CAD Commands," discusses the specific CAD commands used in the DeepCAD model. It provides a table that lists these commands along with their parameters, which are used to describe 3D shapes. The section also includes examples of parametrized command sequences and illustrates how CAD models are constructed using these commands.

1. **Summary in Simple Language:**
   In this section, the paper talks about the commands that computer programs can understand to create 3D shapes. These commands are used in CAD tools. The commands are divided into two types: sketch and extrusion. They are simple but powerful and can be used to make many different shapes. The paper shows a table that lists these commands and what information they need to work. They also provide an example of how these commands can be used to describe a 3D shape, like drawing lines and arcs to create a shape.

3. **Simple Python Code Using PyTorch:**

   Here's a simple Python code snippet using PyTorch to represent a parametrized sequence of CAD commands similar to what's described in the paper. This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes:

   ```python
   import torch

   # Define a sequence of CAD commands and parameters
   cad_sequence = [
       ("<SOL>", None),
       ("L", (2, 0)),
       ("A", (2, 2, 3.1415, 1)),
       ("L", (0, 2)),
       ("L", (0, 0)),
       ("<SOL>", None),
       ("R", (2, 1, 0.5)),
       ("E", (0, 0, 0, -2, -1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 'New body', 'One-sided')),
       ("<SOL>", None),
       ("R", (0, 0, 1.125)),
       ("E", (0, 0, 0, -2, -1, 0, 2.25, 2, 0, 'Join', 'One-sided')),
       ("<EOS>", None)
   ]

   # Print the CAD commands and parameters
   for command, parameters in cad_sequence:
       if parameters is not None:
           print(f"Command: {command}, Parameters: {parameters}")
       else:
           print(f"Command: {command}")
   ```

   This code demonstrates a basic representation of CAD commands and their parameters in a Python list. In the actual DeepCAD model, this representation is more complex and used for training the model to generate CAD designs.

Here are Python functions that correspond to the CAD commands and their parameters as described in the table:

```python
# Define a function for the Line command
def line(x, y):
    # Implement the Line command logic here
    print(f"Line: Go from current point to ({x}, {y})")

# Define a function for the Arc command
def arc(x, y, alpha, flag):
    # Implement the Arc command logic here
    direction = "clockwise" if flag == 0 else "counter-clockwise"
    print(f"Arc: Create an arc to ({x}, {y}) with a sweep angle of {alpha} degrees, going {direction}")

# Define a function for the Circle command
def circle(x, y, radius):
    # Implement the Circle command logic here
    print(f"Circle: Create a circle at center ({x}, {y}) with a radius of {radius}")

# Define a function for the Extrude command
def extrude(theta, phi, gamma, px, py, pz, scale, e1, e2, boolean_type, extrude_type):
    # Implement the Extrude command logic here
    print(f"Extrude: Sketch plane orientation (θ, φ, γ): ({theta}, {phi}, {gamma})")
    print(f"Sketch plane origin (px, py, pz): ({px}, {py}, {pz})")
    print(f"Scale of associated sketch profile (s): {scale}")
    print(f"Extrude distances toward both sides (e1, e2): ({e1}, {e2})")
    print(f"Boolean type: {boolean_type}, Extrude type: {extrude_type}")
```

You can call these functions with the appropriate parameters to simulate the CAD commands. For example:

```python
line(2, 0)
arc(2, 2, 180, 1)
circle(2, 1, 0.5)
extrude(0, 0, 0, -2, -1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 'New body', 'One-sided')
```

These functions will print out descriptions of what each command does based on the provided parameters.
