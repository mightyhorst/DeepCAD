# 3. Method
We now present our DeepCAD model, which revolves
around a new representation of CAD command sequences
(Sec. 3.1.2). Our CAD representation is specifically tailored, for feeding into neural networks such as the proposed
Transformer-based autoencoder (Sec. 3.2). It also leads to a
natural objective function for training (Sec. 3.4). To train our
network, we create a new dataset, one that is significantly
larger than existing datasets of the same type (Sec. 3.3), and
one that itself can serve beyond this work for future research.

# Summary
**Context:**
This section, titled "Method," outlines the key components of the DeepCAD model. It discusses the novel representation of CAD command sequences, the use of a Transformer-based autoencoder, the creation of a large dataset for training, and the formulation of an objective function for the training process.

1. **Summary in Simple Language:**
   In this section, the paper explains how their DeepCAD model works. They've designed a new way to represent CAD commands so that a computer can understand them better. They use a special type of computer program called a Transformer-based autoencoder to teach the computer how to create CAD designs. To teach the computer, they gathered a huge dataset of CAD command sequences, much larger than what was available before. This dataset can also be useful for future research.

3. **Simple Python Code Using PyTorch:**

   While the specific implementation of the DeepCAD model is complex and not covered in this example, you can create a basic Transformer-based autoencoder in PyTorch to get a sense of how such models are structured:

   ```python
   import torch
   import torch.nn as nn

   # Define a simple Transformer-based autoencoder
   class TransformerAutoencoder(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, n_heads, n_layers):
           super(TransformerAutoencoder, self).__init__()
           self.encoder = nn.TransformerEncoder(nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(input_dim, n_heads), n_layers)
           self.decoder = nn.TransformerDecoder(nn.TransformerDecoderLayer(input_dim, n_heads), n_layers)
           self.fc = nn.Linear(input_dim, input_dim)

       def forward(self, x):
           encoded = self.encoder(x)
           decoded = self.decoder(encoded)
           output = self.fc(decoded)
           return output

   # Initialize the autoencoder model
   input_dim = 64  # Example input dimension
   hidden_dim = 128  # Example hidden dimension
   n_heads = 4  # Number of attention heads
   n_layers = 2  # Number of transformer layers

   model = TransformerAutoencoder(input_dim, hidden_dim, n_heads, n_layers)

   # Generate some input data (batch_size, sequence_length, input_dim)
   input_data = torch.randn(32, 10, input_dim)

   # Forward pass
   output_data = model(input_data)

   print(output_data.shape)  # Example: torch.Size([32, 10, 64])
   ```

   This code provides a basic structure for a Transformer-based autoencoder using PyTorch. The DeepCAD model in the paper employs a more complex version of this concept, tailored to CAD command sequences and with additional components, but this example helps illustrate the general idea of using a Transformer-based autoencoder for sequence data.
