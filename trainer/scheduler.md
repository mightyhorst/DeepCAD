**File Overview:**

This file defines the `GradualWarmupScheduler` class, which is a custom learning rate scheduler that gradually increases the learning rate during a warm-up phase before transitioning to another scheduler, such as `ReduceLROnPlateau`. The warm-up phase helps stabilize the training process by initially using a smaller learning rate and then smoothly transitioning to the specified scheduler.

**Imported Modules:**
```python
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import _LRScheduler
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import ReduceLROnPlateau
```
- `_LRScheduler`: Base class for PyTorch learning rate schedulers.
- `ReduceLROnPlateau`: A PyTorch learning rate scheduler based on reducing learning rate when a metric plateaus.

**Class Definitions:**

1. `GradualWarmupScheduler`:
    - A custom learning rate scheduler class.
    - Inherits from `_LRScheduler`.
    - Initializes with an optimizer, multiplier, total number of epochs for warm-up, and an optional after_scheduler.
    - Provides methods to gradually increase the learning rate during warm-up and transition to an after_scheduler.

**Methods and Functions:**

1. `__init__(self, optimizer, multiplier, total_epoch, after_scheduler=None)`:
    - Initializes the `GradualWarmupScheduler` class with the provided parameters.
    - Sets up the multiplier, total epochs for warm-up, after_scheduler, and other internal variables.

2. `get_lr(self)`:
    - Computes the learning rates for the current epoch.
    - Handles the warm-up phase and transition to after_scheduler.

3. `step_ReduceLROnPlateau(self, metrics, epoch=None)`:
    - Custom step function for the case when after_scheduler is `ReduceLROnPlateau`.
    - Adjusts learning rates during the warm-up phase and passes control to after_scheduler when the warm-up phase ends.

4. `step(self, epoch=None, metrics=None)`:
    - Overrides the base class `step` method.
    - Manages the learning rate transition when the after_scheduler is not `ReduceLROnPlateau`.

**Dependencies:**

This file is dependent on the following:
- The `_LRScheduler` and `ReduceLROnPlateau` classes from the PyTorch library.

**Flow:**

1. The `GradualWarmupScheduler` class is initialized with the specified parameters.
2. In the `get_lr` method, the learning rate is computed based on the current epoch, multiplier, and total_epoch. During the warm-up phase, the learning rate gradually increases.
3. The `step_ReduceLROnPlateau` method handles learning rate adjustment for the case when the after_scheduler is `ReduceLROnPlateau`.
4. The `step` method manages the learning rate transition and handles after_scheduler control.

**Paper Relation:**

This code file relates to the paper "DeepCAD: A Deep Generative Network for Computer-Aided Design Models". While the paper doesn't explicitly mention this code, it is crucial for optimizing the training process of the DeepCAD model. The use of a gradual warm-up learning rate strategy followed by a potential transition to `ReduceLROnPlateau` aligns with the broader concepts of improving model convergence and performance during training. This scheduling technique contributes to the overall training stability and efficiency of the DeepCAD model.
