I'm sorry, but I don't have access to the file `/content/code/evaluation/evaluate_ae_acc.py` and cannot provide the code snippet from it. However, based on the file name and the context provided, it seems like the purpose of this file is to evaluate the accuracy of an autoencoder model. It likely contains code that calculates various accuracy metrics for the model's output, such as accuracy for different types of shapes (line, arc, circle) and different parameters (plane, translation, extent).
